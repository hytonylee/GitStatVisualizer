GitStat Visualizer i inspired by React + GitHub API Project (https://github.com/ziad-saab/react-github-api-project/blob/master/README.md). The technologies in this project are ReactJs, ChartJs, GitHub API and SemanticUI. The purpose of the GitStat Visualizer is to be able visualize any public repo on it's number followers, updates and any other status. Most importantly, providing user the ability to compare different repos, so the user can choose the repos they like to use. Additionally, this weekly project is for me to get familiar with REstful API and ChartJs.

The features of the app include the search function to lookup GitHub public repo, comparison function to compare between two or more repos.
